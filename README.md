# My Midterm Project

"This was my attempt to tackle Ironhack's mid-term project. I know that this could have been a lot better, but I tried my best.

I built this website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I tried to cheat the system and not have so many lines in CSS, so I broke the site into 4 components.

Header being one, newsletter second, and footer third.

I have created 4 different HTML files alongside the main index file. The four files were as mentioned before, plus contact.html, which we created in class with Diego's help. After the other 3 HTML files were finished alongside CSS files, I pulled them into the main HTML using a JavaScript method.

I have applied CSS to the main index and tried to make it as similar as possible to the project website provided to us by Diego.

I have managed to create an almost perfect loader for the client. Almost perfect because the gap between the ending of one cycle and the beginning of another is a bit too long.

Unfortunately, I failed completely to recreate the "our services section". I have tried to, but couldn't make it because my code always just broke something else on the page. Another thing I couldn't make work was the burger menu and JavaScript method toggle, where my code just wasn't triggering when it needed to.

And the third thing is responsiveness, in which I didn't do much.

Still, it was a fun project, and I hope that by the end of the class, I will be able to recreate or create new pages without many problems."
